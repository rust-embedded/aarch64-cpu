//! Counter-timer Kernel Control register - EL1
//!
//! When FEAT_VHE is implemented and HCR_EL2.{E2H, TGE} is {1, 1}, this register does not
//! cause any event stream from the virtual counter to be generated, and does not control access to the
//! counters and timers. The access to counters and timers at EL0 is controlled by CNTHCTL_EL2.
//!
//! When FEAT_VHE is not implemented, or when HCR_EL2.{E2H, TGE} is not {1, 1}, this register
//! controls the generation of an event stream from the virtual counter, and access from EL0 to the
//! physical counter, virtual counter, EL1 physical timers, and the virtual timer.
